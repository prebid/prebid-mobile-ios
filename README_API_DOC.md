# Prebid Mobile SDK - iOS API Reference

Prebid iOS SDK is an open-source monetization library that allows you to integrate header bidding demand partners into the mobile app in various ways. The integration documentation can be found [here](https://docs.prebid.org/prebid-mobile/prebid-mobile.html). 

This section is autogenerated documentation describing the SDK's public classes, methods, and other code structures. It doesn't provide any integration guides but always provides updated API references. 

The documentation is generated for each SDK release.  

If you see any inconsistency or want to improve the process, you are always welcome to contribute to [Prebid Mobile iOS SDK](https://github.com/prebid/prebid-mobile-ios) on GitHub.
