  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>This test is a full end-to-end validation through the Prebid Mobile SDK to the primary ad server using the Prebid Server configuration.<p>

    <ul>
    <li><b>Ad unit registered</b><br />This first step is successful if the Prebid Mobile API call was made to register the ad unit.</li><br />
    <li><b>Request to Prebid Server sent</b><br />This step is successful if a bid request was sent from Prebid Mobile to Prebid Server.</li><br />
    <li><b>Prebid Server response received</b><br />This test passes if a bid response was received from Prebid Server.</li><br />
    <li><b>Creative content cached</b><br />This test passes if the creative content from the bid received from Prebid Server was cached.</li><br />
    <li><b>Ad server request sent and Key-value targeting sent</b><br />Verifies whether the bid request was sent. The request will not be sent if the IDs you entered on the <b>Setup</b> page are incorrect. Tap this entry to see a list of key-value pairs that were sent with this request.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Select <b>Prebid Key-Value Pairs</b> to view only the key-values sent that apply to prebid.</li>
        <li>Select <b>Ad Server Request</b> to view the full list of key-values sent in the ad request.</li>
      </ul><br />
      <li><b>Prebid Mobile creative HTML served</b><br />Tap this entry to view:
        <ul>
          <li>the Prebid.js HTML code for the Prebid Mobile creative.</li>
          <li>the creatives that were returned. In a successful test two creatives will be displayed: the creative returned from the ad server and the Prebid.org test creative. Tap the buttons to view each creative.</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

  <h2>Results</h2>

  <p>Possible outcomes from this test:</p>

    <p>Success: This is a full, end-to-end validation of your Prebid Mobile implementation. The validation succeeds if every step passes.</p>
    <p>Failure: There are many steps throughout this validation. If a problem is encountered at any step, the validation will be marked as failed.<br />
      Here are some things to check if this test fails:
      <ul>
        <li>Check all your settings on the Setup screen. In particular, make sure all the IDs you entered are correct and valid.</li>
        <li>Make sure you've configured your ad unit registration correctly.</li>
        <li>Verify that your line items are set up correctly on your ad server.</li>
        <li>Look through your bid request and bid responses (if any). Check the key-value targeting.</li>
        <li>If creatives were returned, view the HTML code and the creatives. The <b>Received Creative</b> and <b>Expected Creative</b> should be identical.</li>
      </ul>
