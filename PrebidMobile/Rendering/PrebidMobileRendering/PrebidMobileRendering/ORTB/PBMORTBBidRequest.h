#pragma mark - 3.2.1: BidRequest

//The top-level bid request object contains a globally unique bid request or auction ID. This id att;ribute is
//    required as is at least one impression object (Section 3.2.4). Other attributes in this top-level object
//establish rules and restrictions that apply to all impressions being offered.
//There are also several subordinate objects that provide detailed data to potential buyers. Among these
//are the Site and App objects, which describe the type of published media in which the impression(s)
//appear. These objects are highly recommended, but only one applies to a given bid request depending
//on whether the media is browser-based web content or a non-browser application, respectively.
