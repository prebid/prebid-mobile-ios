///This object describes the nature and behavior of the entity that is the source of the bid request

///decisioning when the exchange itself does not control the final decision. A common example of this is
///header bidding, but it can also apply to upstream server entities such as another RTB exchange, a
///mediation platform, or an ad server combines direct campaigns with 3rd party demand in decisioning.
