/**
 The MoPub iOS SDK mediates third party Ad Networks using adapters.  The adapters are
 responsible for instantiating and manipulating objects in the third party SDK and translating
 and communicating events from those objects back to the MoPub SDK by notifying a delegate.

 @c MPInlineAdAdapter is a base class for adapters that support banners. By implementing
 subclasses of @c MPInlineAdAdapter you can enable the MoPub SDK to natively support a wide
 variety of third-party ad networks.

 At runtime, the MoPub SDK will find and instantiate an @c MPInlineAdAdapter subclass as needed and
 invoke its @c requestAdWithSize:adapterInfo:adMarkup: method.

 Called when the MoPub SDK requires a new banner ad.

 When the MoPub SDK receives a response indicating it should load an adapter, it will send
 this message to your adapter class. Your implementation of this method can either load a
 banner ad from a third-party ad network, or execute any application code. It must also notify the
 @c MPInlineAdAdapterDelegate of certain lifecycle events.

 @param size The current size of the parent @c MPAdView.  You should use this information to create
 and request a banner of the appropriate size.

 @param info A dictionary containing additional custom data associated with a given adapter
 request. This data is configurable on the MoPub website, and may be used to pass dynamic information,
 such as publisher IDs.

 @param adMarkup An optional ad markup to use.
