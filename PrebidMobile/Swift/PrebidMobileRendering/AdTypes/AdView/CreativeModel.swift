// PBMCreativeModel is visible to the publisher, and defines:
// --- duration indicates the time the creative will display for
// -------- A negative value indicates that this field has not been set
// -------- A value of 0 indicates an indefinite time
// -------- A postitive value indicates that this creative will be displayed for that many seconds
// --- width is the width of the creative, in pixels
// --- height is the height of the creative, in pixels
// --- creativeData is a String:String dictionary that contains all of the data needed to display the creative in a capable view
// -------- Example: An HTML creative would include key "html" with the html code for that creative as the value. A video creative would have a key "videourl" that would point to the asset to be played
// --- trackEvent functions take an enum or string, and cause the tracking URLs associated with those events to be fired
// --- baseURL is an optional base URL to use when loading in an PBMWebView
// @objc and public because it will be used by publishers to display an ad in their own view
